I believe using GitHub and GitHub Pages to create a portfolio is a very professional way to showcase your technical skills and projects to potential employers. 
GitHub allows you to organize your code repositories, document your work, and demonstrate developer expertise. 
when hosting your portfolio on GitHub Pages, you can turn your repository into a live, professional website that anyone can access as long as you keep it Public, or invite someone personally is you are set to Private.
Your portfolio can include an "About Me" section, links to featured projects of your technical work. 
Using visuals like screenshots or diagrams enhances the presentation.
This approach highlights your familiarity with industry-standard tools, your ability to document projects effectively, and your initiative in maintaining an online presence, making you stand out as a strong candidate.
